# image-evolution-ga
Image approximation using minimal set of brush. The image will get better generation to generation.
# Based on Genetic Algorithm
Create a random population at first
* Select the closest result appears in the population for the parent
* Create next generation based on the parent
* Mutate new organism
* Put the parent to the generation to maintain the population movement
* Repeat the process

# Generation #33117
