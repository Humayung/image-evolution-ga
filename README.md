# image-evolution-ga
Image approximation using minimal set of brush. The image will get better generation per generation.
# Based on Genetic Algorithm
Create a random population at first
* Select closest result appaers in the population as the parent
* Create next generation based on the parent
* Mutate every organism
* Put the parent to the generation to maintain the population movement
* Repeat the process
